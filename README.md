# Hello there! 👋

### I'm Arman, your friendly neighborhood Software Engineer!

With nearly a decade of experience under my belt, I've been immersing myself in the intricacies of .NET, shaping server-side magic and orchestrating the digital symphony of ones and zeroes. 🎵 After uprooting my life and moving to Germany, I've embraced the challenge of being a global citizen while continuing my quest in tech.

#### Tech Stack & Expertise:
- 🧠 Core: `.NET` aficionado focusing on building resilient and scalable solutions.
- 🖥️ Frontend Flair: Spicing up user interfaces with `Vue` and `TypeScript`  expertise.

- 🚀 Architecture: Venturing into the vast cosmos of `distributed systems` and `microservices architecture`.

#### Outside the Code:
When I'm not indulging in the art of programming, I blend into the world of rock music 🎸, letting the rhythm fuel my soul. I also live by the way of the warrior, dedicating myself to sports like Kyokushin (極真) Karate and Kick Boxing. 🥋

#### Did You Know?
- 🥇 Mastery: Proud bearer of 5 Martial Arts Black Belts Dans that reflect my dedication and discipline.
- 🏅 Champion: With a collection of over 20 national competition medals, my commitment to excellence is beyond just code.

### Let's Connect!
I'm always down for a tech talk, martial arts strategies, or playing a competitive match on Counter Strike 2.
